Feature: sbt template

  Scenario: correct sbt template
    When I run `lc system view-template sbt`
    Then it should succeed
    And the output should contain all of these:
      | sbt:     |
      | test:    |
      | package: |
    And the output should not contain "sbtscratch"
    When I run `lc --enable-scratch-volumes system view-template sbt`
    Then it should succeed
    And the output should contain all of these:
      | sbtscratch:     |
      | sbt:     |
      | test:    |
      | package: |
