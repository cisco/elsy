Feature: Leiningen template
  Scenario: correct lein template
    When I run `lc system view-template lein`
    Then it should succeed
    And the output should contain all of these:
      | lein:     |
      | test:    |
      | package: |
    And the output should not contain "mvnscratch"
    When I run `lc --enable-scratch-volumes system view-template lein`
    Then it should succeed
    And the output should contain all of these:
      | mvnscratch:     |
      | lein:     |
      | test:    |
      | package: |
